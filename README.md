# Brain-Tumour-Image-Detection-Using-Deep Learning 
Image segmentation is used to separate objects from the background.

Brain tumor segmentation is the process of separating the tumor from normal brain tissues; in clinical routine, it provides useful information for diagnosis and treatment planning.

However, it is still a challenging task due to the irregular form and confusing boundaries of tumors ,it has proved to be a powerful tool in bio-medical imaging ,Building an deep learning model to recognise cell images as Infected/Uninfected, Binary classification task. 

As a deep learning model we used convolution neural networks as they perform great in fetching important information from images.
